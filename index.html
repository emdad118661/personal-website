            <p>
                In 2022, My graduation will be completed hopefully. I have to complete this programming hero course, my
                2 unofficial thesis, an official thesis. Moreover, I have to find an internship before that. I have to
                be focused in this year. I think this year will make my future ahead. I have alredy shown my skill
                trough some project. Take a look those on github.
